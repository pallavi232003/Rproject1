Project-Bangalore Traffic Analysis

Goal:
The main objective was to understand traffic patterns in Bangalore, identify congestion hotspots, and propose actionable insights for smoother traffic flow—especially focusing on peak hours and accident-prone zones.

Datasets & Tools:

Dataset: Bangalore traffic police data (accidents, vehicle counts), public datasets (weather, roadwork), and Google Maps traffic APIs.

Tools:

Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data wrangling.

Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualizations.

QGIS for spatial analysis and heatmaps.

Key Insight/Deliverable:
We identified that traffic congestion was highest near IT corridors during weekday mornings (8–10 AM) and evenings (5–8 PM). A significant correlation was found between rain and increased accident rates (~25% spike). The deliverable was a detailed report with visual dashboards and a heatmap showing accident hotspots, which can assist in better urban traffic planning.
